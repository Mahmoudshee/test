        <h1>PROGRAMMING</h1>
        <h4>Why do we need to learn programming?</h4>
        <p>

            Programming teaches you how to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components. It
            enhances your analytical and critical thinking abilities, enabling you to devise effective solutions to a
            wide range of challenges.

        <h4> What is Coding? </h4>
        <p>
            Coding is the practice of building websites and apps by writing out instructions in a programming language.
            It governs how data is collected, how sites appear to the user, and every aspect of how you engage with the
            web.

            The background on this page appears the way it does due to lines of code. And when you enter your email
            address in a pop-up box, code is guiding the way your email is stored and shared.

            Computers can perform extremely fast calculations, complete complex mathematical tasks, and store large
            amounts of data. It’s fair to say the majority of humans would struggle to keep up.

            But computers require a detailed set of instructions to perform these tasks. This is where coding comes in.

            Machines use binary code to communicate and operate. Computer programming (or simply coding) refers to the
            task of writing instructions that, once compiled, computers will understand and follow. It therefore allows
            us to create a range of different software from operating systems and business packages to mobile apps and
            video games.
        </p>
        <h4>What Does A Coder Do?</h4>
        <p>
            A professional coder is responsible for building, testing, and enhancing the sites, apps, and software that
            power our world.

            Some coders choose to specialize in building the user-facing portion of the site (called front-end
            development). They guide how the site looks and feels.

            Others specialize in the inner operations of the site, or back-end development. They’re called on to set up
            the infrastructure and make sure data is housed properly.

            Professional coders spend most of their time typing out lines of code, checking for bugs, testing their code
            on different platforms and devices, and perfecting it. It requires focus, acute problem-solving skills, and
            a sharp eye for detail.

            But that doesn’t mean that coders work alone. Many actually work in large teams of software engineers.
            Together, they build solutions, troubleshoot each other’s work, and try to build the ideal final product for
            their company or client. Soft skills like clear communication and collaboration are key if you want to excel
            in this field.
        </p>
        <h4>How Much do Coders Make?</h4>
        <p>
            The salary of a coder depends on how much experience you have, and your areas of specialty. According to
            Indeed.com, the Front-End Developers make an average salary of $108,628, and Back-End Developers typically
            earn $125,091 per year. If you’re ambitious, you could increase your salary potential even more by learning
            both front-end and back-end programming languages.

            Coders who are committed to constantly learning new languages and perfecting their skill have the potential
            to earn well into the six figures. If you’re also patient, open to advice and critiques from team members,
            and skilled at communicating with senior leaders, you’ll be on track to move up the ranks, and grow your
            career far beyond the Junior Developer stage.
